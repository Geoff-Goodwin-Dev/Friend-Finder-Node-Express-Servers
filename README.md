# Friend Finder - Survey Results Compatibility App

* **Created:** Saturday, May 5th, 2018

* **Context:** This is the thirteenth week's homework assignment as a part of the Georgia Tech Coding Bootcamp. In this assignment, we are building a 'full stack' application with Express.js, node.js, etc. for routing management and with multiple pages.  The homework's high level instructions are as follows:

```
In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match. 

You will use Express to handle routing. Make sure you deploy your app to Heroku so other users can fill it out.
```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

```
Though you can do your own local install, it is also deployed on heroku for ease of use: https://gg-friend-finder-app.herokuapp.com/
```

### Prerequisites

These are things you need to install the software and how to install them:
